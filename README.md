# raman_spectroscopy
Hyperspectral image processing.


This repository represents code used to process hyperspectral Raman images generated by WiTEC Control4 software.
Raman Hyperspectral maps are images where each pixel has an associated spectrum. Pixels are color coded based on the
intensity of the spectrum at a given wavenumber. This code was originally used to process Raman image data for organic materials
found in various types of meteorites, but can be used with any material of interest. 

You'll find the various scripts used to process the collected images in this repository as well as example files necessary to run the processing work on. Please reach out to me or contribute if you have suggestions.

Right now the scripts used to analyze output Raman data are cross language (I.e. some in python some in Matlab). I realize that people may 
not have access to Matlab or would rather just use one language. As such I'm working on implementing two fully working processing 
pipelines in both languages. Thanks for your patience!
