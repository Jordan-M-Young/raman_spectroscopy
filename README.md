Hyperspectral image processing.


This repository represents code used to process hyperspectral Raman images generated by WiTEC Control4 software.
Raman Hyperspectral maps are images where each pixel has an associated spectrum. Pixels are color coded based on the
intensity of the spectrum at a given wavenumber. This code was used to process Raman image data for organic materials
found in various types of meteorites. The region of interest for carbonaceous materials in a Raman spectrum is generally
between 900-2000 (cm-1). The features of interest in an organic spectrum are the D and G bands at (~1360 and ~1580 cm-1).
In order to gather quantitative information about a materials structure, its important to extract spectral parameters from 
the spectral bands of interest.
